web crawling tool i'm making for my buddy in solar sales
so far poorly made, but still thinking about what kind of AI is best for this use case. For now, im thinking linear regression model or random forest. However, there's really no open source models trained on data that works for him. I've been thinking about an image processing model that uses google earth or something similar, but my inspiration for this project has come to a hault.
